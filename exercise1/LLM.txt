I have used LLM for writing code to get Docker uptime and available disk space, as I was not aware of how to fetch them through code. I also used it to resolve an issue in Service1, where I was getting no response, and the LLM suggested binding ASP.NET Kestrel with 0.0.0.0 using webBuilder.UseUrls("http://0.0.0.0:8199"). Additionally, I used it to get the command for fetching OS details, as well as for documentation purposes such as spell checking and fine-tuning.
